  ## Description
  This program uses Node.js and the inquirer v. 8.2.4 npm to generate a quality README.md file using input gathered from a series of prompts. 
  
  ## Installation
  First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you do not, you can download the [latest version](https://nodejs.org/en/).

  Next, you will need to create a fork from the make-a-readme repository, then clone the repository to your local system. If you need help please follow the instructions outlined in [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

  Once you have cloned succesfully, install inquirer v.8.2.4 by running "npm install inquirer@8.2.4" in your terminal. For more information, check out the [inquirer.js docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).
  
  ## Usage
  Once everything is installed, run "node index.js" in your terminal. You will be prompted with a series of questions that will gather the necessary data to generate your README.md file. Upon completion, the message "README.md file created!" will display in the terminal and a README.md file will be created and added to your local repository. If, for some reason, it was unsuccesful, an error message will display instead.

  For more information, please see the [video demo](). Note: for demonstration purposes, the file created in the demo is titled sampleREADME.md. The final version generates the title README.md.
